                An innovative map for the Saint-Quentin-En-Yvelines's website
            </h5>

            <p>What was the project idea ?</p>
            <p>In this project that i did during the 2021's summer for the community's agglomeration of Saint-Quentin-En-Yvelines, the web-ingeneer that were supporting me asked me to propose an innovative way to demonstrate the progress of each city's construction site and works.
            It made me reflect so much time because their website is pretty complete and already had all the firsts ideas that i had in mind. Nevertheless i found a way to reinnovate this website by introducing an interactive map into it.
            I looked on the web what could i use to get it working, and in 5 weeks, i finished imaginating and coding this innovative item. Actually, i found out that a library called <i>MapBox</i> was doing exactly what i wanted.
            The first step, was to learn how to use this library, which was kinda complicated in less than 1 week if would still have enought time to code my project entirely. Then i started coding it, more or less quickly, and finished by present it to my tutor's boss. 
            He didn't understand how it worked because he didn't know much about web-development, but my mentor said that my work was really good and that he was satifyed of what i did.
