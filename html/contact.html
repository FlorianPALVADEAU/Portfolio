I am passionate about coding, and I'm always trying to push my limits in order to increase my knowledge and reduce my weaknesses according to each programming language.
                My goal is to become the best web-developer that i could ever be, and I'm really determined to, maybe one day, become a renowned developer.

                I do not fear challenges, and always try to do my best to defeat them. Besides, I am very social and open-minded, which i think is a pretty good advantage in the digital world, because it allows me to be team-spirited and to understand my working mates easier.</p>

During this period, i have mainly learnt the basics of the adobe's suite, which provided me the fundamentals of the web digital world.<br><br>
                              ‣ Four years later, i did a five weeks long internship in the same company, but this time development purpose : it did consist in designing and developing an innovative interactive map that had to be integrated to a legacy website for modernizing it.

            <p class="skillsInfo reveal">Thanks to my school and a part of my curiosity, i have been able to develop many <b>hardskills</b> in the web-development area. I am able to realize a complete website from the wireframe to the development and the FTP.
                My main coding languages are HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PhP but i can also use Sass, MySQL, JSON, Python, and i am currently learning vue.js and Symfony by myself. Moreover, i will learn later this year additional skills such as Swift or Resr APIs.
                In addition to this, i am very comfortable with CAD softwares and video making like Photoshop, Sony Vegas Pro, as well as Illustrator, XD, Lightroom, InDesign, 3DSMax, Cinema4D, Unity. Here are a couple of projects i did last year with this softwares : <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cewk3741fy3ebz9/AACx9KDEcRv_zIdGd1FNEDt1a?dl=0" target="_blank">see my dropbox project's file</a><br>
                
                Complementarily, i acquired basics skills of video game designing and programming. Here is the link to my video game : <a href="https://youtu.be/zZXLvoesPe8" target="_blank">Rootie's Run</a><br><br>

                Luckily, my school is giving lessons of <b>softskills</b> to it's students, in order to prevent them of the embarrassing situations that could happen in the professional working area, or simply in the real life.
                I have learnt to work in team, how to manage my stress, my timetable, some angry people, and many other stuff, but also how to behave correctly and professionally from a situation to another.

                            <p>An innovative map for the Saint-Quentin-En-Yvelines's website</p>
                            <p>What was the project idea ?</p>
                            <p>In this project that i did during the 2021's summer for the community's agglomeration of Saint-Quentin-En-Yvelines, the web-ingeneer that were supporting me asked me to propose an innovative way to demonstrate the progress of each city's construction site and works.
                            It made me reflect so much time because their website is pretty complete and already had all the firsts ideas that i had in mind. Nevertheless i found a way to reinnovate this website by introducing an interactive map into it.
                            I looked on the web what could i use to get it working, and in 5 weeks, i finished imaginating and coding this innovative item. Actually, i found out that a library called <i>MapBox</i> was doing exactly what i wanted.
                            The first step, was to learn how to use this library, which was kinda complicated in less than 1 week if would still have enought time to code my project entirely. Then i started coding it, more or less quickly, and finished by present it to my tutor's boss. 
                            He didn't understand how it worked because he didn't know much about web-development, but my mentor said that my work was really good and that he was satifyed of what i did.

                            <p>This project was imposed to be done by my school if i wanna pursue my studies in the web-development axis. We had to make a full website with at least : a parallax animation, a live-error formulary, a working blog(with a wysiwyg interface, and a fully secured administration system), a gallery with filter and masonry effect, some comments under it with an anti-swearing, ... 
                            This project was very formative, it allowed me to work by myself even if i didn't know how to do or anything, i learnt to study and search all by my side.

                            <p>During an upgrading skills week in JS, we asked our professor with one of my comrade something challenging that we've never worked on before, and he told us to make a website printing all the elements presents in a JSON file, with one page gathering the students, another gathering the professors, another for the direction, and finally another with the explanations of how we did it.</p>

                            <p>During my secondary year of studying web-development at the IIM, we will have to develop, with five of my comrades, a working e-commerce goodies website to allow the assosiations of our school to sell their goodies online to the rest of the world. For this, we will use Shopify as a back-end CMS, and Stripe to manage payments. At this time, we only started the project 2 weeks ago so we only did the wireframing and designing-system part, but i will update this page all over the year upcoming, so stay tuned if you want to see the final result ! :)</p>
